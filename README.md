Benefits:
   Enhances the overall organization of the codebase, making it easier to understand and navigate.
   Facilitates easier adaptation to changing requirements or technologies by allowing specific parts of the system to be modified independently.
   
   
6. Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
   Unit Testing: Focuses on individual components or functions of the software. Developers test each unit of code in isolation to ensure it performs as expected.
                Identifies bugs early in the development process, facilitates code refactoring, and verifies that each unit works correctly.
   Integration Testing: Tests the interactions between integrated units or modules. This level ensures that combined parts of the system work together correctly.
                        Detects interface defects, data flow issues, and integration problems between modules.
   System Testing: Validates the complete and integrated software system. Tests the system as a whole against the specified requirements.
                   Ensures the entire system functions correctly and meets the specified requirements in a real-world scenario.
   Acceptance Testing: Conducted by end-users or clients to determine whether the software meets their needs and requirements. It includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and often involves testing in a production-like 
                    environment.
                    Confirms the systemâ€™s readiness for deployment and use by the end-user, ensuring it satisfies business requirements.
Importance of Testing in Software Development:
